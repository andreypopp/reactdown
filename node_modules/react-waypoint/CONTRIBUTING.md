We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great
   to know that you have a clean slate: `npm install && npm test`.
3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
   require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we
   need a test!
4. Make the test pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
